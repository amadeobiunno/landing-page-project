# Landing Page Project

This project is all about javaScript. It consists of bulding a navigation menu from a "ul" and populating said "ul" with links using jS only.
Once the menu was created each link had to scroll to a certain section on the lannding page and denote what section it was in by showing an active tab on the menu.
